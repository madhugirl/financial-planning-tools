#  In this program we analyze the probable returns using the Monte Carlo simulation.
#  We use a 3 year history of financial date from stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies to 
#  determine which ratios of investments will allow the client to retire early
#  We used a 10 year Monte Carlo simulation and a 10 year Monte Carlo simulation 
#  to determine the 95% probable high and low returns on investments
#  We also analyzed the ratio of stocks and bonds to calculate the highest returns
